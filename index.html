        <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich</li>
        <li>API (application programming interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software</li>
        <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false</li>
        <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.</li>
        <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code. </li>
        <li>Command+Option+I: opens Chrome Dev Tools</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
